Grocery POS system FYP

This Project is a sketch mockup of a web-based portable POS system for small scaled grocery businesses

Today, 28th December, 2023, I've managed to complete the model interface that I had planned 2 years ago in 2021
of the Portable (Grocery) Point-Of-Sales System, and I feel satisfied. Changes will still be made though, not for
perfection, but for the purpose of improvements.

You should check out the Laravel Project App, synced in well with the interface.
